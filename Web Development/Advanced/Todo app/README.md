# Todo CRUD app - MERN stack

The full form of CRUD is Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database or any persistent storage system.

- **Create**: This operation adds new data to the database. For example, adding a new record in a table.
- **Read**: This operation retrieves data from the database. For example, fetching records from a table.
- **Update**: This operation modifies existing data in the database. For example, changing values of an existing record.
- **Delete**: This operation removes data from the database. For example, deleting a record from a table.
These operations are fundamental to managing and manipulating data in a database, ensuring that users can interact with the data effectively.

This is a simple todo app, demonstrates CRUD operations in MERN stack.
